    <div id="content"><img src="img/Arceus.jpg" /></br>Arceus is the Alpha Pokemon and is Pokedex #493. He was first introduced in a Pokemon event, but was originally programmed to be obtainable in game, this changed by release. He is a special Pokemon who depending on what type of plate or Z-Crystal he is holding, he changes to that type of pokemon. Ie, Fire plate=Fire type, Water Z crystal= Water type, and no plate or Z-crystal= normal type. The reason he is on this list is because he is believed to be the creator/god of all pokemon. Believed to have hatched from an egg  in the void and to have then created the universe. Even though this Pokemon was made until the 4th generation and many many years after the other Possible First pokemon were even thought of, he is still a candidate for the first Pokemon. Although it also depends if you count the Legendary Pokemon as Pokemon Since they Are mostly older and very different from their regularly appearing counterparts.
